# F# Web Arkanoid-like

A simple browser game I made to try out F# web development.

Compiled to Javascript with the [Fable](https://fable.io/) compiler. Uses the [Elmish](https://elmish.github.io/elmish/) architecture.

Development is halted for now, though in the future I might add features like multiple lives, power-ups and so on.
